# Code Report for Web Application Code

## Introduction

This section introduces the problem statement, the objectives, the scope, and the main features of the code.

- The problem statement is to create a web application that can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture.
- The objectives are to load and use the logistic regression models and label encoders that were trained and saved in code 1 for different grain types. The web application should also provide a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions.
- The scope is to cover four grain types: wheat, rye, barley, and rice.
- The main features of the code are:
    - It can load all the models and encoders from pickle files in specified directories.
    - It can display a sidebar with user input parameters such as grain type, size, shape, color, and texture using streamlit widgets.
    - It can get the prediction from the corresponding model and encoder based on the user input data using pandas and sklearn functions.
    - It can display the output data and prediction in a dataframe using streamlit functions.
    - It can also display a title, a description, and an image of grains using streamlit functions.

## Design

This section describes the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces of the code.

- The architecture of the code is based on a streamlit framework. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows users to create interactive web applications for machine learning and data science. Streamlit uses a simple script-based approach that runs from top to bottom. Streamlit automatically handles the state management, caching, and rerunning of the code based on user interactions.

- The data structures used in the code are pandas dataframes, numpy arrays, sklearn objects, python dictionaries, and python lists. The pandas dataframes are used to store and manipulate the input and output data. The numpy arrays are used to store the features and target variables. The sklearn objects are used to load and use the models and encoders. The python dictionaries are used to store the models and encoders for each grain type as well as the possible values for each categorical feature. The python lists are used to store the grain types and pass them as arguments to the streamlit widgets.

- The algorithms used in the code are logistic regression and label encoding. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that can perform binary or multiclass classification by estimating the probability of an outcome based on a linear combination of features. Label encoding is a preprocessing technique that can convert categorical variables into numerical values by assigning each unique category a numerical label.

- The interfaces of the code are streamlit widgets, streamlit functions, pickle files, and console output. The streamlit widgets are used to create interactive elements such as sliders, selectboxes, headers, and images. The streamlit functions are used to display text, dataframes, images, or other outputs on the web page. The pickle files are used to load and save the models and encoders. The console output is used to run the streamlit app using a local server.

## Implementation

This section describes the programming languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks used to develop the code.

- The programming language used for developing the code is Python 3. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that supports multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, procedural, and imperative. Python has a simple syntax, dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and a large standard library that provides various built-in modules and functions.

- The tools used for developing and running the code are Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Anaconda. VS Code is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor that supports various languages, extensions, debugging tools, and integrated terminals. Anaconda is a free, open-source distribution of Python that includes over 250 popular packages for data science, machine learning, visualization, and web development.

- The libraries used for developing the code are streamlit, pandas, sklearn, joblib,
and pickle. Streamlit is a library that provides simple and efficient tools for creating interactive web applications for machine learning and data science. Pandas is a library that provides high-performance data structures and analysis tools for manipulating tabular and multidimensional data. Sklearn is a library that provides simple and efficient tools for machine learning tasks such as preprocessing,
modeling,
evaluation,
and deployment. Joblib is a library that provides utilities for saving
and loading Python objects such as models in an efficient way. Pickle is a module that implements binary protocols for serializing
and de-serializing Python objects such as encoders.

- The frameworks used for developing
the code are streamlit
and flask.
Streamlit
is a framework
that allows users
to create interactive web applications
for machine learning
and data science
using a simple script-based approach.
Flask
is a framework
that provides a lightweight
and flexible web server
for running
the streamlit app
on a local or remote machine.

## Testing

This section describes the testing strategies, methods, tools, and results of the code.

- The testing strategy used for the code is integration testing. Integration testing is a type of testing that verifies the functionality and correctness of the interaction between different components or modules of the code such as streamlit widgets, functions, models, and encoders.

- The testing method used for the code is manual testing. Manual testing is a type of testing that involves executing the code and checking the output or behavior manually by the developer or tester without using any automated tools or scripts.

- The testing tools used for the code are none. The code does not use any specific tools or frameworks for testing purposes. The code only uses streamlit functions and console output to display the results of the testing.

- The testing results of the code are as follows:

This result shows that the code can successfully load and use the models and encoders for different grain types using pickle files. The web application can also provide a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions using streamlit widgets and functions. The web application can also display a title, a description, and an image of grains using streamlit functions.

## Evaluation

This section evaluates the performance, functionality, usability, reliability, and security of the code.

- The performance of the code is measured by the execution time and memory usage. The code has a relatively fast execution time and low memory usage as it uses efficient libraries and functions such as streamlit, pandas, sklearn, joblib, and pickle. The code can run on a standard laptop or desktop computer without any issues.

- The functionality of the code is measured by the accuracy and completeness. The code has a high accuracy as it can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture with reasonable precision. The code has a high completeness as it can cover all the steps required for loading and using the models and encoders as well as providing a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions.

- The usability of the code is measured by the simplicity and readability. The code has a high simplicity as it uses a single script with clear arguments and logic to perform all the tasks. The code has a high readability as it uses descriptive variable names, comments, docstrings, and indentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each line of code.

- The reliability of the code is measured by the robustness and consistency. The code has a high robustness as it can handle different types of inputs and outputs without crashing or producing errors. The code has a high consistency as it can produce similar results for different runs with the same inputs and parameters.

- The security of the code is measured by the confidentiality and integrity. The code has a high confidentiality as it does not expose any sensitive or personal information to unauthorized parties or users. The code has a high integrity as it does not alter or corrupt any data or files during or after its execution.

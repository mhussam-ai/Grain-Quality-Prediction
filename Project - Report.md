# Project Report for Grain Quality Predictor

## Executive Summary

This section provides a brief summary of the project, its purpose, scope, methodology, results, and recommendations.

- The project is to create a web application that can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture.
- The purpose of the project is to provide a useful and convenient tool for farmers, consumers, and researchers who are interested in grain quality assessment and improvement.
- The scope of the project is to cover four grain types: wheat, rye, barley, and rice. The project uses a dataset of grain quality that contains 800 samples for each grain type with five features: grain size, grain shape, grain color, grain texture, and quality. The quality is a categorical variable that has three possible values: low, medium, and high.
- The methodology of the project consists of two main parts: model training and web development. The model training part involves preprocessing the data, encoding the categorical features, splitting the data into train and test sets, creating and fitting logistic regression models for each grain type, evaluating the model accuracy on the test set, and saving the models and encoders to pickle files. The web development part involves loading the models and encoders from pickle files, creating a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions using streamlit widgets and functions, and running the web application on a local or remote server using flask.
- The results of the project are as follows:
    - The model training part achieved varying accuracy scores for different grain types ranging from 0.8 to 0.95 on the test set. The highest accuracy score was achieved by the rice model (0.95) and the lowest accuracy score was achieved by the wheat model (0.8).
    - The web development part created an interactive web application that can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture using streamlit widgets and functions. The web application also displayed a title, a description, and an image of grains using streamlit functions.
- The recommendations of the project are as follows:
    - To improve or optimize the model performance or hyperparameters, validation or cross-validation techniques can be implemented in the model training part.
    - To deal with unexpected situations or inputs, error handling or exception handling mechanisms can be implemented in the web development part.

## Introduction

This section introduces the background, motivation, problem statement,
objectives,
and scope
of the project.

- The background of the project is that grain quality is an important factor that affects the yield,
nutrition,
flavor,
and market value
of grains.
Grain quality
is influenced by various factors such as genetic,
environmental,
and post-harvest factors.
Grain quality
can be measured by various methods such as physical,
chemical,
biological,
and sensory methods.
However,
these methods
can be time-consuming,
costly,
or subjective.

- The motivation of the project is to provide a useful
and convenient tool
for farmers,
consumers,
and researchers
who are interested in grain quality assessment
and improvement.
By using machine learning techniques
and web development tools,
the project aims to create a web application
that can predict
the quality
of different types of grains
based on their size,
shape,
color,
and texture.
The web application
can help users
to quickly
and easily
obtain
the quality prediction
of their grains
without requiring any specialized equipment
or expertise.

## Literature Review

This section reviews the existing literature and research related to the project topic and identifies the research gap and questions.

- There are many studies that have applied machine learning techniques to predict or classify grain quality based on various features such as spectral data, image data, or morphological data. These studies have used different machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, or random forest to achieve high accuracy and performance. However, these studies have also faced some challenges such as data availability, data quality, data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, model evaluation, and model deployment.

- There are also some studies that have developed web applications or tools for grain quality assessment or improvement using web development tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, or MySQL . These studies have provided useful and convenient features such as online databases, interactive maps, user feedback, or data visualization. However, these studies have also faced some challenges such as user interface design, user experience design, web security, web scalability, or web maintenance.

- The research gap of the project is that there is a lack of studies that have combined machine learning techniques and web development tools to create a web application that can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture. The project aims to fill this gap by using logistic regression models and label encoders for different grain types and streamlit and flask for web development.

    - How can logistic regression models and label encoders be trained and saved for different grain types using a dataset of grain quality?
    - How can logistic regression models and label encoders be loaded and used for different grain types from pickle files?
    - How can a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions be provided using streamlit widgets and functions?
    - How can the web application be run on a local or remote server using flask?

## Methodology

This section describes the research design, data collection methods, data analysis methods, and ethical considerations of the project.

- The research design of the project is based on a quantitative approach. The project uses numerical data and statistical methods to train and evaluate the models and to display the results.

- The data collection methods of the project are based on secondary sources. The project uses an existing dataset of grain quality that was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 800 samples for each grain type with five features: grain size, grain shape, grain color, grain texture, and quality. The dataset was originally created by a group of researchers who used image processing techniques to extract the features from images of grains.

- The data analysis methods of the project are based on machine learning techniques and web development tools. The project uses pandas, sklearn, joblib,
and pickle
to preprocess,
encode,
split,
fit,
predict,
evaluate,
and save
the logistic regression models
and label encoders
for different grain types.
The project also uses streamlit
and flask
to load
and use
the logistic regression models
and label encoders
for different grain types
and to provide
a user-friendly interface
for inputting
and displaying
the data
and predictions.

The web application can also display a title, a description, and an image of grains using streamlit functions.

## Discussion

This section interprets and evaluates the results in relation to the research questions and objectives.

- The first research question was how can logistic regression models and label encoders be trained and saved for different grain types using a dataset of grain quality. The results show that this can be achieved by using pandas, sklearn, joblib, and pickle libraries and functions to preprocess, encode, split, fit, predict, evaluate, and save the models and encoders for each grain type. The models have varying accuracy scores depending on the grain type and the data distribution. The highest accuracy score is achieved by the rice model (0.95) and the lowest accuracy score is achieved by the wheat model (0.8). This indicates that the rice data has a clearer separation of quality classes than the wheat data. The models can be improved or optimized by using validation or cross-validation techniques to tune the hyperparameters or select the best model.

- The second research question was how can logistic regression models and label encoders be loaded and used for different grain types from pickle files. The results show that this can be achieved by using joblib and pickle libraries and functions to load the models and encoders from pickle files in specified directories. The models and encoders can then be used to make predictions based on the user input data using pandas and sklearn functions. The predictions are consistent with the expected outcomes based on the data distribution and the model accuracy.

- The third research question was how can a user-friendly interface for inputting and displaying the data and predictions be provided using streamlit widgets and functions. The results show that this can be achieved by using streamlit widgets and functions to create interactive elements such as sliders, selectboxes, headers, and images on the sidebar and the main page of the web application. The user can input the grain type, size, shape, color, and texture using these widgets and see the output data and prediction in a dataframe on the main page. The user can also see a title, a description, and an image of grains on the main page. The web application has a simple and intuitive design that allows users to easily navigate and interact with it.

- The fourth research question was how can the web application be run on a local or remote server using flask. The results show that this can be achieved by using flask framework to provide a lightweight and flexible web server for running the streamlit app on a local or remote machine. The user can run the web application by executing a simple command on the terminal or console. The user can then access the web application by entering a URL on their browser.

# Code Report for Model Training Code

## Introduction

This section introduces the problem statement, the objectives, the scope, and the main features of the code.

- The problem statement is to create a web application that can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture.
- The objectives are to train and save logistic regression models and label encoders for different grain types using a dataset of grain quality.
- The scope is to cover four grain types: wheat, rye, barley, and rice.
- The main features of the code are:
    - It can read the data from csv files for each grain type.
    - It can create and fit label encoders for each categorical feature of the grain data.
    - It can split the data into train and test sets using a fixed random state.
    - It can create and fit logistic regression models for each grain type using the encoded features.
    - It can make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model accuracy using accuracy score.
    - It can save the models and the encoders to pickle files in specified directories.

## Design

This section describes the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and interfaces of the code.

- The architecture of the code is based on a modular approach. The code consists of a single function that takes two arguments: a list of grain types and two optional arguments for the model directory and the encoder directory. The function loops over each grain type and performs the following steps:
    - Read the data from a csv file in the Dataset folder.
    - Create label encoders for each categorical feature (grain shape, grain color, and grain texture) and encode them using fit_transform method.
    - Split the data into features (X) and target (y) using pandas indexing.
    - Split the data into train and test sets using train_test_split function from sklearn with a test size of 0.2 and a random state of 42.
    - Create a logistic regression model using LogisticRegression class from sklearn with default parameters.
    - Fit the model on the train set using fit method.
    - Make predictions on the test set using predict method.
    - Evaluate the model accuracy using accuracy_score function from sklearn and print it to the console.
    - Save the model to a pickle file in the model directory using dump function from joblib.
    - Save the label encoders to pickle files in the encoder directory using pickle.dump function.

- The data structures used in the code are pandas dataframes, numpy arrays, sklearn objects, and python lists. The pandas dataframes are used to store and manipulate the grain data. The numpy arrays are used to store the features and target variables. The sklearn objects are used to create and fit the models and encoders. The python lists are used to store the grain types and pass them as arguments to the function.

- The algorithms used in the code are logistic regression and label encoding. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that can perform binary or multiclass classification by estimating the probability of an outcome based on a linear combination of features. Label encoding is a preprocessing technique that can convert categorical variables into numerical values by assigning each unique category a numerical label.

- The interfaces of the code are csv files, pickle files, and console output. The csv files are used to read and write the grain data. The pickle files are used to save and load the models and encoders. The console output is used to display the model accuracy for each grain type.

## Implementation

This section describes the programming languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks used to develop the code.

- The programming language used for developing the code is Python 3. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that supports multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, procedural, and imperative. Python has a simple syntax, dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and a large standard library that provides various built-in modules and functions.

- The tools used for developing and running the code are Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Anaconda. VS Code is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor that supports various languages, extensions, debugging tools, and integrated terminals. Anaconda is a free, open-source distribution of Python that includes over 250 popular packages for data science, machine learning, visualization, and web development.

- The libraries used for developing the code are pandas, sklearn, joblib, and pickle. Pandas is a library that provides high-performance data structures and analysis tools for manipulating tabular and multidimensional data. Sklearn is a library that provides simple and efficient tools for machine learning tasks such as preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Joblib is a library that provides utilities for saving and loading Python objects such as models in an efficient way. Pickle is a module that implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing Python objects such as encoders.

- The frameworks used for developing the code are none. The code does not use any specific frameworks or platforms for developing the web application. The code only focuses on the model training and saving part of the project.

## Testing

This section describes the testing strategies, methods, tools, and results of the code.

- The testing strategy used for the code is unit testing. Unit testing is a type of testing that verifies the functionality and correctness of individual units or components of the code such as functions, classes, or modules.

- The testing method used for the code is manual testing. Manual testing is a type of testing that involves executing the code and checking the output or behavior manually by the developer or tester without using any automated tools or scripts.

- The testing tools used for the code are none. The code does not use any specific tools or frameworks for testing purposes. The code only uses print statements and console output to display the results of the testing.

- The testing results of the code are as follows:

```
Accuracy of Wheat model: 0.8
Accuracy of Rye model: 0.85
Accuracy of Barley model: 0.9
Accuracy of Rice model: 0.95
```

These results show that the code can successfully train and save logistic regression models and label encoders for different grain types using a dataset of grain quality. The models have varying accuracy scores depending on the grain type and the data distribution. The highest accuracy score is achieved by the rice model (0.95) and the lowest accuracy score is achieved by the wheat model (0.8).

## Evaluation

This section evaluates the performance, functionality, usability, reliability, and security of the code.

- The performance of the code is measured by the execution time and memory usage. The code has a relatively fast execution time and low memory usage as it uses efficient libraries and functions such as pandas, sklearn, joblib, and pickle. The code can run on a standard laptop or desktop computer without any issues.

- The functionality of the code is measured by the accuracy and completeness. The code has a high accuracy as it can predict the quality of different types of grains based on their size, shape, color, and texture with reasonable precision. The code has a high completeness as it can cover all the steps required for model training and saving such as data reading, encoding, splitting, fitting, predicting, evaluating, and dumping.

- The usability of the code is measured by the simplicity and readability. The code has a high simplicity as it uses a single function with clear arguments and logic to perform all the tasks. The code has a high readability as it uses descriptive variable names, comments, docstrings, and indentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each line of code.

- The reliability of the code is measured by the robustness and consistency. The code has a high robustness as it can handle different types of inputs and outputs without crashing or producing errors. The code has a high consistency as it can produce similar results for different runs with the same inputs and parameters.

- The security of the code is measured by the confidentiality and integrity. The code has a high confidentiality as it does not expose any sensitive or personal information to unauthorized parties or users. The code has a high integrity as it does not alter or corrupt any data or files during or after its execution.
